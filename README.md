Shards
======
    
Ruby has Rubygems, Node.js has NPM, Python has PyPI and well client side JS will have Shards.

### Concept
JavaScript as a language has no real client side repository of standard libraries, 
just take all the frameworks and their plugins/extensions as examples. The best bet of finding a good library is to search for one. 
Shards aim to fill this hole.

It will provide a website to host and serve libraries, with online documentation, specs and versioning, bulding and minifying
production code, with easy integration into any website project.
